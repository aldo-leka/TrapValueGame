# UI/UX Rules: TIKR Style & Swiping

## The "Blind" Financial Table
- **Aesthetic:** Dark mode, high-density grid (TIKR/Bloomberg style).
- **Rows (The "Must-Haves"):** - Revenue, Gross Margin %, EBITDA, Net Income.
  - **Value Specifics:** Free Cash Flow, Total Debt, Cash & Equivalents, Shares Outstanding (to show dilution/buybacks).
- **Hidden Identity:** The Ticker and Company Name are HIDDEN until after the swipe. Use "Project Alpha" or "Retailer X" as placeholders.

## Narrative Component
- Use a typewriter effect for the Gemini-generated "Historical Backdrop."
- It should mention: "It is January 2018. The sector is facing headwinds from..." without giving away the name.

## Swiping & Result Reveal
- **Swipe Left (TRAP):** Red overlay.
- **Swipe Right (VALUE):** Green overlay.
- **The Reveal:** On completion, transform the table into a **Chart View**. Show the price line starting from the SnapshotDate for 2 years.
- **Outcome Logic:** If Player chose VALUE and ROI > 15%, "WIN." If ROI < 0%, "TRAPPED."
